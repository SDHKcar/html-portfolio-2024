<h1>The Movies I Never Get Tired Of Watching</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr>
<h2>Transformers (1986)</h2>
<p>Great movie with great voice actors such as Lenoard Nimoy, Peter Cullen, Orson Welles, Frank Welker and Casey Kasem. The animation is all hand drawn, and the music really brings the movie to a complete experience.</p>
<h2>Back to the Future Trilogy</h2>
<p>These movies give a glimpse of what society thought the future would be like. Looking at them now, there are some misses but the writers definietly helped bring about our current way of living.</p>
<h2>Jaws</h2>
<p>This movie started the whole "All sharks must be killed" style of thinking back in 1975. This movie is also great by horror standards by building up suspense and only showing a little bit of the shark throughout the film.</p>
