        <p>Hello! My full name is Domingo Rainier Almazan Fernandez III, but I go by Rainier. I am a Navy veteran, I spent my entire term in Yokosuka, Japan from 2005 - 2008. While stationed there, I learned the Japanese martial art of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo">Kendo</a>. I have achieved the rank of GoDan (5th degree black belt) from an accelerated experimental program.
