    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My full name is Domingo Rainier Almazan Fernandez III, but I go by Rainier. I am a Navy veteran, I spent my entire term in Yokosuka, Japan from 2005 - 2008. While stationed there, I learned the Japanese martial art of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo">Kendo</a>. I have achieved the rank of GoDan (5th degree black belt) from an accelerated experimental program.
        My Navy term ended in 2008. Upon returning to civilian life, I decided to go to school for cake decorating in 2008. I graduated as the only male in the course in 2009. Then in 2010, I went to ITT Technical Institute to learn to be an IT specialist. I graduated with my Associates in 2013, then with my Bachelors in 2015. After graduating, I got a job at Sycuan Casino. After leaving
        that workplace, I got a job at a Korean BBQ. I became the kitchen lead due to my military experience.</p>
